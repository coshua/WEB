## Queries

### Where
The 'where' clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
Many clauses can be made by joining And or OR keywords.

It can be used with the following syntax.
`col_name operator condition`

All string in the queries must be quoted.
